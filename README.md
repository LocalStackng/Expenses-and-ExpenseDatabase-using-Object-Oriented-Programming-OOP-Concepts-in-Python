# Expenses and ExpenseDatabase using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Python

**Description** <br>
This project focuses on implementing a system to handle expenses and an expense database using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.
The implementation involves defining Python classes that encapsulate attributes, methods and functionalities related to managing and manipulating expenses.

The main components of the project are comprised of two essential classes that allow users to efficiently manage and manipulate expenses:
1. Expense Class: This class encapsulates individual expenses. It includes attributes to represent specific details of an expense (like title, amount, unique identifier, timestamps for creation and update). The class methods allow users to update expense details and convert expenses into a dictionary format.
2. ExpenseDB Class: This class represents an expense database. It manages a collection of expenses through methods that enable adding, removing, and retrieving expenses based on unique identifiers, titles, or converting the entire collection into a dictionary format.
